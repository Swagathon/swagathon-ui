    "description": "Verus is scalable public infrastructure for the world. Delivering public\r\ninfrastructure services such as blockchain and token creation,\r\nself-sovereign digital identities, DeFi, secure vaults and privacy.\r\nOrganizations, companies and entrepreneurs use the rent-free,\r\ndecentralized multichain network to build blockchain-based systems,\r\nbusinesses, products and services.\r\n\r\nLaunch independent, interoperable, scalable and fully customizable\r\npublic or private blockchains with Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a\r\nService). Ready within minutes. Miners and stakers of the worldwide\r\nVerus network are ready to support your independent blockchain with no\r\nadditional cost or effort. Makers can focus on one thing only; creating\r\nproducts and services they care about.\r\n\r\nCreate tokens with the most powerful token experience in the crypto\r\nindustry. Verus token technology can provide for any use case. From\r\ntickets and coupons to voting cards and meme-tokens. Fully customizable\r\nfor anyone's needs.\r\n\r\nWhether projects start a blockchain or token, each connects to the\r\nglobal network of liquidity provided by Verus. Powerful built-in DeFi\r\ntechnology makes sure projects have instant liquidity. Remember the days\r\nwhen projects needed an exchange listing to create a market or find\r\nliquidity? Those days are over.\r\n\r\nVerus is uniquely positioned to be at the center of the crypto industry.\r\nAll blockchains, public or private, can easily connect to Verus through\r\nadvanced bridging technology. Blockchains and tokens can connect to the\r\nglobal network of liquidity, and take advantage of all Verus has to\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Verus?\r\nVerus was founded by a community collective and launched in May 2018.\r\n\r\nOne community member is lead developer Michael Toutonghi, an industry\r\nveteran that earned his stripes as a talented programmer and systems\r\ndesigner. His wealth of experiences include being recognized founder and\r\narchitect of Microsoft\u2019s .NET platform and former Vice President and\r\nTechnical Fellow at Microsoft. He is also an experienced digital\r\nidentity, distributed computing, and machine learning architect.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Verus Unique?\r\nVerus solves many problems still troubling the crypto industry today\r\nbecause of design choices made from the start. Unlike other blockchain\r\nsystems, everything on Verus happens on the protocol layer (Layer 1),\r\nrather than through add-on Layer 2 solutions.\r\n\r\nVerus is a multichain network where anyone can create customizable,\r\nindependent, interoperable, and scalable blockchains with a few\r\ncommands, provisioned by miners and stakers of the Verus network. Verus\r\nsolves the scalability issue without sacrificing security and\r\ndecentralization.\r\n\r\nVerus has simultaneous processing of conversions, making front-running\r\nimpossible. Due to design choices, Verus does not suffer from MEV (Miner\r\nExtractable Value). It keeps the protocol fair for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nVerus aims to be a giant network of value connecting all\r\ncryptocurrencies. Creating a global economy everyone can earn from.\r\n\r\nHow Many Verus (VRSC) Coins are There in Circulation?\r\nThe maximum supply is 83,540,184 VRSC. All coins in circulation are\r\nearned by mining and staking.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Verus never had an ICO, didn\u2019t have a premine\r\nand has no developer or founder fees. It is a true community project in\r\nthe spirit of Bitcoin. There are no companies, people, or other entities\r\nthat take rent from the Verus multichain network.\r\n\r\nHow is the Verus Network Secured?\r\nThe Verus multichain network is secured through proof-of-work and\r\nproof-of-stake. It combines the best of both worlds; energy-efficient\r\nstaking, and robust, secure mining.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, every miner can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains\r\nsimultaneously with shared hashrate, creating a green mining revolution\r\nand making mining on the Verus multichain network incredibly energy\r\nefficient and profitable.",
